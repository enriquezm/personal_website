### Intro

My name is Myles Enriquez and I'm a freelance Front End Web Developer and User Experience Designer. My specialty is  in usability. I've been a developer for nearly 5 years now and a user experience designer for 2 years.

### Experience.
I've worked with personal websites to college sized websites. Most of my work has been on websites but I have also worked with web and mobile applications.

### Personal traits.

I have an entrepreneurial mindset, pay attention to detail, and personally care about each project that I am involved with. I always give 110% and try to fulfill user needs, behaviors and goals.

### Motivation.

Why do I do any of this? Why do I develop with a focus in user experience? I do all this because I personally hate when things (not just digital) are difficult to use and frustrate me. Instead of complaining about it, I decided to take it into my own hands and help out with the community.

My goal is to design and develop products that all of us enjoy to use. I have a heart and passion in this field and plan to do everything I can to make everyone's life better.

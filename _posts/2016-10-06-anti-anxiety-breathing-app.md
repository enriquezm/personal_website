## Overview

An app that aids in breathing exercises with a synced visualization. To calm the mind, and ease your anxiety away.

<hr />

## Action

Steps taken to design the app.

### 1. Sentiment Analysis

Before starting with the design. It was time to do some research. Some questions that I wanted answered were:

1. What users were saying right now about mindful breathing.
2. What they like/dislike about it.
3. Find trends/topics and study them.

All of this was to get a better understanding of what people would think about the app. After a couple days of research. I came up with these conclusions to the previous 3 questions:

1. Mindful breathing helps to overcome anxiety or stressful situations.
2. Improves focus, patience, and overall happiness.
3. With the latests trend of overall wellness, people are starting to pay more attention to themselves and their overall health. Practices such as yoga bring in mindful breathing.

### 2. Concept Statement

After a quick research sprint it was time to create my app's concept statement. The Concept Statement is a summary of what your app is envisioned as. With this, I will be able to later decide on what features and uses cases available.

- Product Name: Anti-Anx
- Target Users: Those needing to overcome anxiety, stress, or just need a general breathing exercise/meditation for the day.
- One-line description: Anti-Anx helps ease away anxiety and stress.
- what problems app will solve: Anxiety, prevent stressful environments, overall person's well-being.
- what experience app will provide the user: A controlled and timed environment.

### 3. Brainstorming

I wanted something visual of course but not just that. It needed to be in some way meditative, attracting, and something that encouraged a sort of relaxing/calm emotion from the user. The first place I looked was [meditative coloring](https://mandalacoloringmeditation.com/mandala-coloring/mandala-articles/about-mandala-coloring-healing/).

From there I wanted something more than just a static image. This app had to incorporate breathing exercises with some type of visual animation. So then I thought of what you would see in a kaleidoscope.

As you can see both images were too complicated and overwhelming to ease and calm anxiety or stress. If anything, the kaleidoscope image may have caused even more anxiety than to begin with. So this led me to look for something a little more minimal and simple.

And finally something that was exactly what I had in mind. The below image animates in a way that can be synced to someone's breathing. Though, this specific animation is moving at a faster pace than I would would for a calm breathing exercise, but that can be slowed down. Syncing your breath with the animated image puts you into a trance like state allowing you to focus only on your breathing and not minding anything else. If you don't believe me, give it a go with the image below.

Exhale as the image compresses and inhale when the image expands. Just remember that this animation is a lot faster than the final product would be.

### 4. Storyboard

To help and aid me in my designing decisions, I decided to storyboard my app to get a better perspective of what I need to incorporate. I wanted to portray 2 main situations that a user would be in when using the app.

1. Situation A: In a stressful situation, needs app fast.
2. Situation B: In a stressless situation, just wants to do some breathing exercises.

Situation A:

(1) User is dealing with a bad day at work. With all the customers coming in ordering their coffee, user has to keep up with the pace. Customers are rude and demanding a lot. (2) User needs to take a quick 5 min break and tells co-worker to man the bar while user steps back to take a breather. (3) User starts app, selects the type of breathing they need right now at the moment and starts their breathing exercises to calm down. (4) After a couple breaths, user feels better and steps back out to work.

Situation A Quick Takeaways:

- App needs to get to the point fast.
- Breathing exercises should be simple, concise, and to the point.
- There should be different timed exercises.
- There should be different styles of breathing.

Situation B:

(1) User wants to do their daily breathing exercises for the day. They open the app and look through for the type of breathing they're looking for. (2) They find a session that is 10 mins long and find a comfortable seat to start their session. (3) After their session they feel relaxed and more focused. They enjoyed the session and want to save it for later.

Situation B Quick Takeaways:

- App needs to have different types of geometric shapes.
- App needs variety. (times, colors, shapes, animations, sounds?)
- App needs to have a 'favorites/profile' type of setting.
- Breathing exercises should have varied speeds of breathing (ex fast to slow). Possibly make current breathing speed of user adjusted to app.

### 5. User Journeys

### 6. Sketching

Next part was making a couple of sketches for the actual application. I found the centralized idea for the app (visualized animation), I just needed to sketch and find a way to give the user a great experience when needed to use the app. The app had to be accessible, quick to deliver and not too complicated. We wanted to reduce anxiety, stress, etc. as soon as the app was in use. Not just when viewing the animation.

### 7. Wireframing

### 8. Hi-Fi Prototype

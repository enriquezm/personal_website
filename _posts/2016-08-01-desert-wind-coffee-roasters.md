## Overview
The DWCR Website Redesign team consists of 3 members, including myself. Two members are fairly new to the user experience, web design/development field, and so for this project my role is to act as a guide and head of the user experience, design, and development for the project. Main goal is to help the two members get into the field and come out with the skills and tools to design and develop their own websites in the future.

## Why the problem matters
This problem matters because of the potential business you can gain from online purchases. This is a coffee roastery/shop, and if we can increase orders online for delivers, we can increase business and reputation for the shop.

## Action
We took the following steps.

### 1. Website Audit
First steps within the team and the project were to audit the current site. This required going through the site and layout out its current structure and content.

Some discovered issues were: (1) images not being optimized, (2) lack of consistency, (3) website was not responsive, and (4) information on site was not accurate.

These are just initial discoveries and we hope to find more as the project continues.

### 2. Personas
For the personas, we decided to each create 1. There are a total of 3 teammates, so 3 personas would be created. To stay consistent, I decided to follow the same outline for all 3 personas.

The outline of each persona was as follows:

1. Fictional Name
2. Job Title/Major Responsibilities
3. Demographics
4. Goals and Tasks
5. Environment

We'll use these personas to help us shape out the design of the website. The plan is to use these personas as a reference when design decisions need to be made. The process of creating personas was a little easy because of the fact that we could use any one of our customers as one of our personas.

### 3. Mood Board
After completing a couple personas, the team and I moved onto creating a mood board. This mood board was meant to serve as a canvas for any type of ideas or thoughts that we had in mind, in terms of design.

Items such as fonts, colors, design themes, etc. we posted on the mood board. Each of these items were based off of the personas that we created. Since we had a target audience in mind, we went on with that when selecting items for the mood board.

Once the mood board becomes complete we will sort through, discuss and filter the ideas into something more complete on its own.

### 4. Card Sorting

With the basic theme of the site and experience 85% set in stone, we moved on to how our information on the site would be laid out. The easiest way for this, was to handle it with card sorting.

Everything offered on the site was written down on pieces of paper, which were to be sorted into stacks that made sense, per "sorter". After the stacks were set and organized, we each needed to go through eat stack and categorize it as well.

This helped us sort information that would be presented on the site, into groups that made more sense.

### 3. Wireframes

Because this project was mostly being done remotely, I decided that my team and I should collaborate using an app called 'Figma'. Figma let's you work on designing in real time with your teammates.

### 4. First Round Wireframe Testing

## Results
We concluded with the following results:
